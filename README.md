# Project Problem Description:
There are certain pitfalls in the traditional way of handwritten text. It is difficult to
store and access unlike digital documents. A way to tackle this issue is to convert
handwritten text to digital. Handwritten characters can be digitized through
different techniques that have evolved over the years. For this project, we want to
focus on classification techniques. Three popular classification techniques are
Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and OCR using Pattern Matching.
To provide a better translation of handwritten characters, comparing the accuracy
and performance of each technique is needed. We are observing the accuracy of
these techniques using the same dataset. Then we will compare the performance
of each technique and see if one method is more efficient than the other.

# Project Solution :
 ○ Pre-processing of dataset
 
 ○ Data training/testing
 
 ○ Post-processing
 
 ○ Data visualization or extract patterns
